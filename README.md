# nevolution
another roleplay calculator

this one is something something go details to be filled in later

to-do list:
- making mutations work as intended (they are supposed to happen in a specific biome and create a new grade; i'll probably have to rewrite some code)
- improving the code with utility commands like BiomeID() and GradeID()
- deleting functions i will never need (partially completed)
- splitting the rollback command into two (partially completed in the sense there are now two statements but not two discord commands) 
- renaming all variables named rows to something else unless that makes sense (probably already done with that? depends on definition of sense) (edit: probably done with this)
- creating a set type if i ever use the struct{}{} structure (so far i don't think i have any in use) (edit: maybe i do?)
